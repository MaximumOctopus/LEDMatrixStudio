Everything is fully functional, though there maybe the occasional bug! Please let me know if you find a bug or other problem.

You will have to copy the LEDMatrixStudio folder structure (from the latest public beta build) to your build environment, otherwise some parts (like language selection) won't work or will cause errors.
